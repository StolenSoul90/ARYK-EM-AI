# ARYK-EM-AI

## Overview

ARYK-EM-AI is a **personal AI assistant** designed to grow and learn **alongside its creator**. Unlike traditional AI models loaded with vast predefined knowledge, ARYK-EM-AI will evolve in intelligence, adapting to new information and experiences as the user progresses. This project is being meticulously handcrafted **from scratch in Rust**, with no third-party libraries, tools, or frameworks.
***
## Vision

- A **fully self-built AI assistant** tailored to the user's personal growth and learning.
- Created entirely using the **Rust Programming Language** for maximum performance and reliability.
- **No third-party libraries, plugins, or external tools** - every component will be custom-built.
- Developed using **Neovim v0.10.4** as the primary IDE.
- Open-Source, allowing others to follow along and contribute.
***
## Features & Goals

- **Custom-built Machine Learning Framework** - No reliance on external AI libraries.
- **Personalized Knowledge Growth** - ARYK-EM-AI learns alongside the creator.
- **Efficient Rust-Based Processing** - Optimized for memory safety, concurrency, and performance.
- **Handcrafted Fuzzy Finder & Storage System** - Custom data retrieval and indexing.
- **Minimalist Codebase** - Built for efficiency and clarity.
***
## Project Roadmap

ARYK-EM-AI will be developed in structured **phases**, each focusing on a key foundational component. The high-level roadmap is as follows:

1. **Rust Fundamentals & Setup**
    - Memory management, ownership, and concurrency.
    - Building the first core utilities.
2. **Text Processing & Data Handling**
    - Creating a custom tokenizer and text parser.
    - Designing an efficient, Rust-based data storage system.
3. **Basic AI & Machine Learning Infrastructure**
    - Implementing a lightweight neural network from scratch.
    - Handwriting backpropagation and training algorithms.
4. **Building the AI Memory & Evolution System**
    - Designing a long-term memory mechanism.
    - Creating a knowledge-updating framework.
5. **Interactive AI & Assistant Functionality**
    - Developing real-time interaction and response capabilities.
    - Expanding context-awareness and adaptive learning.
